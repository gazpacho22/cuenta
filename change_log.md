### Constitution shaped for beginner workflow
- I filled in the project constitution so it now explains our beginner-friendly rules, the BDD testing habit, and the MVP focus.
- I updated the planning, specification, and task templates so they remind us to write Given/When/Then tests, keep notes simple, and log updates in `change_log.md`.
- I set the constitution version to 1.0.0 and wrote down the ratification date so we have a clear starting point.

**Impacted files**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/templates/plan-template.md`, `.specify/templates/spec-template.md`, `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`

**Next steps**: Follow the new principles on the next feature by planning BDD tests first and writing a short beginner summary in this log when the work is done.
