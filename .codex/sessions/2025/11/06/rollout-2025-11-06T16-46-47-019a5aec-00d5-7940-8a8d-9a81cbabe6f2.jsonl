meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\\n  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\\n  \\n  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\\n  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\\n  - Developed independently\\n  - Tested independently\\n  - Deployed independently\\n  - Demonstrated to users independently\\n-->\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Capture Expense via Telegram (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAs a business owner chatting with the bot on Telegram, I want to describe an expense in everyday language so it can be recorded in ERPNext without opening the accounting system.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Delivers the core promise of hands-free expense capture, saving time for busy users.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Send a message such as \\\"Paid $10 cash for taxi\\\" and confirm the bot posts a matching ERPNext expense after approval.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the user is an authorized Telegram contact linked to their ERPNext profile, **When** they send \\\"I just had an expense of $10 from my cash account to the taxi account\\\", **Then** the bot replies with a summary showing amount, debit, credit, narration, and **Then** upon explicit confirmation the record appears in ERPNext with matching details and the bot shares the ERPNext document reference.\\n2. **Given** the user sends an expense message that references multiple possible ERPNext accounts, **When** the bot parses the text, **Then** it asks the user to choose the correct account before presenting the confirmation summary.\\n3. **Given** the user rejects the confirmation, **When** they reply \\\"cancel\\\" (or similar), **Then** the bot confirms the cancellation and no ERPNext entry is created.\\n4. **Given** someone whose Telegram account is not linked to ERPNext tries to submit an expense, **When** they send a message describing the expense, **Then** the bot declines the request and explains how to request access from a finance administrator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Guide Missing Details (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAs a user, I want helpful prompts when my message is incomplete so I can fix it quickly instead of guessing what went wrong.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Clear guidance prevents frustration and builds trust in the bot’s assistance.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Send a partial message like \\\"Paid the taxi\\\" and confirm the conversation results in a complete, accurate expense or a graceful stop.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the user submits \\\"Paid the taxi\\\", **When** the bot detects the missing amount, **Then** it asks for the amount before continuing the flow.\\n2. **Given** the user references an unknown account name, **When** the bot fails to find a matching ERPNext ledger, **Then** it tells the user the account is not recognized and offers next steps such as choosing an alternative or asking an administrator to add it.\\n3. **Given** ERPNext rejects an otherwise valid expense (for example, due to a closed accounting period), **When** the bot receives the error, **Then** it presents the failure reason in chat and offers to retry later or escalate to finance support.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Retain Conversation Trail (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAs a finance reviewer, I want to see the Telegram conversation that justified an expense so I can audit the entry\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 90% of straightforward expense messages (amount and accounts clearly stated) result in the correct ERPNext accounts without manual intervention during pilot testing.\\n- **SC-002**: Median time from user message to confirmed ERPNext record remains under 60 seconds for successful submissions.\\n- **SC-003**: 100% of expenses recorded through the bot include a reference to the originating Telegram message and approving user.\\n- **SC-004**: Weekly error rate for failed ERPNext submissions stays below 2% after launch, with each failure surfaced to the user at the time it occurs.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Finance administrators will pre-register eligible Telegram users and provide each with a one-time code to link their chat identity to ERPNext.\\n- The finance team maintains a curated list of account aliases so the bot can translate common phrases to official ERPNext ledger names.\\n- Approved expenses will be recorded as ERPNext Journal Entries with debit/credit lines matching the user’s message unless finance policy changes later.\\n- ERPNext exposes an audit-friendly field where the original Telegram message text and identifiers can be stored or referenced.\\n- Current finance policy has no high-value approval threshold; all confirmed expenses should post automatically.\\n\\n## Knowledge Sharing Requirements\\n\\n- Summarize the feature in beginner-friendly language for `change_log.md`, highlighting how Telegram conversations create ERPNext expenses after confirmation.\\n- Update onboarding materials to explain how to link a Telegram account, submit an expense, review confirmations, and locate the resulting ERPNext records.\\n- Document required test suites (BDD chat scenarios, unit parsing checks, integration tests against a sandbox ERPNext tenant) and ensure they are referenced in CI instructions.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

→ A: Queue the confirmed expense intent, retry automatically with backoff, and notify the user upon success or final failure.\\n- Q: How should the bot handle users repeating the same expense message shortly after approval? → A: Treat each repeated message as a new expense without duplicate checks.\\n- Q: What happens if the expense amount exceeds a configured approval threshold? → A: Ignore all high value spend thresholds because none are configured.\\n- Q: How long should the bot keep retrying a confirmed expense when ERPNext stays unreachable?

It also provides middlewares for auth and throttling needed for finance data.  \\nAlternatives considered: `aiogram` (excellent but steeper learning curve for beginners, fewer synchronous examples in LangChain modules), manual REST polling (lighter dependency but would require rebuilding update parsing, keyboards, and rate limiting).\\n\\n## LangGraph Conversation Architecture\\n\\nDecision: Model the assistant with a `StateGraph` capturing `messages`, `conversation_summary`, `expense_draft`, `clarifications_needed`, and `erpnext_submission` fields, using `LangGraph` conditional edges to branch between information gathering, account resolution, confirmation, and ERP submission nodes.  \\nRationale: Mirrors module patterns (intent classifier → tool execution → human-in-the-loop) while keeping state explicit for auditing. Conditional edges let us loop for follow-up questions until the expense draft is complete before confirmation.  \\nAlternatives considered: A simple sequential chain (would complicate retries and branching for missing details), pure AgentExecutor (less transparent state management, harder to persist checkpoints), bespoke asyncio FSM (re-implements features LangGraph already provides).\\n\\n## Memory Strategy\\n\\nDecision: Persist conversation state with `langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver`, store the last 6 user/assistant messages in `messages`, and trigger a reducer node that summarizes older turns into `conversation_summary` when the window exceeds 6.  \\nRationale: Aligns with course guidance on checkpoint savers, gives Copilot-style “recent history + summary”, and the SQLite backend survives restarts. Summaries keep token usage bounded while retaining context for long-running finance chats.  \\nAlternatives considered: Unlimited history (token blow-up, expensive OpenAI calls), custom Redis store (more ops overhead), LLM-based retrieval memory per query (unnecessary complexity for MVP).\\n\\n## Account Resolution Tooling\\n\\nDecision: Retrieve the full ERPNext chart of accounts on each expense turn and provide it directly to the LLM so it can choose debit/credit ledgers without local caching or embeddings.  \\nRationale: Avoids reliance on OpenAI embedding APIs (currently unavailable) and keeps v1 simple while still giving the model all necessary data to pick accurate matches.  \\nAlternatives considered: Local caching + embeddings (deferred until embedding access issues resolved), fuzzy-matching heuristics (risk of incorrect ledger selection without semantic signals).\\n\\n## ERPNext Journal Entry Integration\\n\\nDecision: Use REST `POST /api/resource/Journal Entry` with bearer token auth (`token <api_key>:<api_secret>`), composing payloads with `accounts` debit/credit rows, `posting_date`, and custom fields storing the Telegram message ID + conversation URL; queue failures in SQLite for retry with exponential backoff up to 15 minutes.  \\nRationale: ERPNext’s documented REST pattern is stable, works with the existing API credentials, and journal entries accept structured account rows. Persisting retries locally satisfies the clarification about outage handling.  \\nAlternatives considered: ERPNext GraphQL (not universally enabled), Frappe client library (adds dependency with minimal benefit), webhook-based custom DocType (more ERPNext customization than necessary).\\n\\n## Testing Approach\\n\\nDecision: Adopt `pytest` for unit/integration coverage and `pytest-bdd` for the Given/When/Then chat scenarios referenced in the spec.  \\nRationale: Keeps the stack consistent (single test runner), integrates with fixtures for Telegram/ERP mocks, and lets us express BDD scenarios directly in `.feature` files that align with Constitution requirements.  \\nAlternatives considered: `behave` (separate runner complicates CI), plain pytest without BDD (violates Constitution), Robot Framework (overkill for Python-first repo).\\n\\n## Deployment & Scaling Assumptions\\n\\nDecision: Run the LangGraph + Telegram worker locally while connecting over HTTPS to the hosted ERPNext instance using existing API keys; continue targeting up to 50 concurrent users and 500 expenses/day.  \\nRationale: Matches the current infra setup (cloud ERPNext, local bot runtime), keeps network boundaries simple, and still supports the expected pilot scale.  \\nAlternatives considered: Deploying the bot beside ERPNext in the cloud (adds ops work for v1), assuming offline ERPNext access (inaccurate given hosted instance).\\n\\n## Documentation & Knowledge Sharing\\n\\nDecision: Update `change_log.md` with a beginner-friendly summary after implementation sessions and extend onboarding docs with a Quickstart covering env setup, Telegram linking, and ERPNext tracing steps.  \\nRationale: Satisfies Constitution Principles I & V and ensures stakeholders can track progress without inspecting code.  \\nAlternatives considered: Relying on inline code comments only (insufficient for onboarding), deferring documentation to post-implementation (risks omissions).\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

`confirmation_status=\\\"pending\\\"`.\\n4. **Awaiting Confirmation → Approved/Rejected**: User response toggles status. Rejection clears `expense_draft`.\\n5. **Approved → Posting**: Call ERPNext. On success populate `erpnext_submission` and clear `clarifications_needed`. On failure enqueue `RetryJob`.\\n6. **Posting → Retrying**: Retry worker dequeues job, attempts ERPNext call until success or 15-minute window expires.\\n7. **Retry Exhausted**: Notify user of final failure, log in `error_log`, keep job for manual follow-up.\\n\\n## Validation Rules\\n\\n- Amounts must be positive decimals; currency defaults to company base currency if unspecified.\\n- Accounts used for debit/credit must not be marked `is_group`.\\n- Journal entry must balance: sum(debits) == sum(credits) for payload.\\n- Telegram users must be mapped to ERPNext contacts before processing messages.\\n- Conversation summaries regenerate whenever `messages` length exceeds six to preserve context while controlling token usage.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.1}}"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\\n\\n### User Story Dependencies\\n\\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\\n\\n### Within Each User Story\\n\\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written in Given/When/Then form and FAIL before implementation\\n- Models before services\\n- Services before endpoints\\n- Core implementation before integration\\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\\n\\n### Parallel Opportunities\\n\\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\\n\\n```bash\\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\\nTask: \\\"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\\\"\\n\\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\\n\\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\\n\\n### Incremental Delivery\\n\\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\\n- Commit after each task or logical group\\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Polish tasks (T031–T033) land last.\n+- **Critical task links**:\n+  - T006 depends on T004 for credential loading.\n+  - T013 relies on T006 for ERPNextClient access to fetch_chart_of_accounts.\n+  - T021 and T022 extend the nodes and builder created in T014 and T015.\n+  - T028–T030 extend state and memory components introduced by T005 and T014.\n+- **Story independence**: Each user story phase concludes with its tests passing, ensuring deployable increments before moving on.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Parallel Execution Examples\n+\n+- **User Story 1**: T010, T011, and T012 can be authored in parallel before implementation; once tests exist, execute T013 → T014 → T015 sequentially, then T016 and T017.\n+- **User Story 2**: T018, T019, and T020 can proceed concurrently; follow with T021 → T022 → T023 → T024.\n+- **User Story 3**: T025, T026, and T027 can run together; after that, complete T028 → T029 → T030.\n+- **Shared phases**: T005 can begin while T004 is in progress, and T031–T033 can be divided among team members after all story work is complete.\n+\n+---\n+\n+## Implementation Strategy\n+\n+### MVP First (User Story 1)\n+\n+1. Execute T001–T009 to establish the foundation.  \n+2. Deliver T010–T017 and confirm all US1 tests pass.  \n+3. Deploy or demo the Telegram capture flow as the initial MVP.\n+\n+### Incremental Delivery\n+\n+1. With US1 stable, implement T018–T024 to add guidance and retry handling.  \n+2. Next, complete T025–T030 to satisfy audit requirements.  \n+3. Finish with T031–T033 to polish logging, documentation, and rollout notes.\n+\n+### Parallel Team Strategy\n+\n+1. Split Setup/Foundational tasks among team members (T001–T009).  \n+2. After US1 tests are drafted, one engineer owns T013–T017 while others progress US2 tests (T018–T020).  \n+3. Once US1 is merged, dedicate streams to US2 implementation (T021–T024) and US3 test preparation (T025–T027).  \n+4. Reconverge for US3 implementation (T028–T030) and collectively wrap up Polish tasks (T031–T033).\n*** End Patch"}}
