If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.\n\n2.

Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):\n   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any \"Constitution Check\" or rules align with updated principles.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.\n   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).\n   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.\n   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.\n\n5.

Module 6 addresses deploying your agents. \\nIn each module folder, you'll see a set of notebooks. A link to the LangChain Academy lesson is at the top of each notebook to guide you through the topic. Each module also has a `studio` subdirectory, with a set of relevant graphs that we will explore using the LangGraph API and Studio.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n### Python version\\n\\nTo get the most out of this course, please ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later. \\nThis version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph. If you're on an older version, \\nupgrading will ensure everything runs smoothly.\\n```\\npython3 --version\\n```\\n\\n### Clone repo\\n```\\ngit clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy.git\\n$ cd langchain-academy\\n```\\nOr, if you prefer, you can download a zip file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).\\n\\n### Create an environment and install dependencies\\n#### Mac/Linux/WSL\\n```\\n$ python3 -m venv lc-academy-env\\n$ source lc-academy-env/bin/activate\\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n#### Windows Powershell\\n```\\nPS> python3 -m venv lc-academy-env\\nPS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process\\nPS> lc-academy-env\\\\scripts\\\\activate\\nPS> pip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n### Running notebooks\\nIf you don't have Jupyter set up, follow the installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\\n```\\n$ jupyter notebook\\n```\\n\\n### Setting up env variables\\nBriefly going over how to set up environment variables. \\n#### Mac/Linux/WSL\\n```\\n$ export API_ENV_VAR=\\\"your-api-key-here\\\"\\n```\\n#### Windows Powershell\\n```\\nPS> $env:API_ENV_VAR = \\\"your-api-key-here\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### Set OpenAI API key\\n* If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can sign up [here](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/).\\n*  Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment \\n\\n### Sign up and Set LangSmith API\\n* Sign up for LangSmith [here](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/create-account-api-key#create-an-account-and-api-key), find out more about LangSmith and how to use it within your workflow [here](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith). \\n*  Set `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2=true` `LANGSMITH_PROJECT=\\\"langchain-academy\\\"`in your environment \\n*  If you are on the EU instance also set `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`=\\\"https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com\\\" as well.\\n\\n### Set up Tavily API for web search\\n\\n* Tavily Search API is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG, aimed at efficient, \\nquick, and persistent search results. \\n* You can sign up for an API key [here](https://tavily.com/). \\nIt's easy to sign up and offers a very generous free tier. Some lessons (in Module 4) will use Tavily. \\n\\n* Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in your environment.\\n\\n### Set up Studio\\n\\n* Studio is a custom IDE for viewing and testing agents.\\n* Studio can be run locally and opened in your browser on Mac, Windows, and Linux.\\n* See documentation [here](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/studio#local-development-server) on the local Studio development server. \\n* Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the `module-x/studio/` folders for module 1-5.\\n* To start the local development server, run the following command in your terminal in the `/studio` directory in each module:\\n\\n```\\nlanggraph dev\\n```\\n\\nYou should see the following output:\\n```\\n- 🚀 API: http://127.0.0.1:2024\\n- 🎨 Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024\\n- 📚 API Docs: http://127.0.0.1:2024/docs\\n```\\n\\nOpen your browser and navigate to the Studio UI: `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`.\\n\\n* To use Studio, you will need to create a .env file with the relevant API keys\\n* Run this from the command line to create these files for module 1 to 5, as an example:\\n```\\nfor i in {1..5}; do\\n  cp module-$i/studio/.env.example module-$i/studio/.env\\n  echo \\\"OPENAI_API_KEY=\\\\\\\"$OPENAI_API_KEY\\\\\\\"\\\" > module-$i/studio/.env\\ndone\\necho \\\"TAVILY_API_KEY=\\\\\\\"$TAVILY_API_KEY\\\\\\\"\\\" >> module-4/studio/.env\\n```\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

No dependencies on other stories\\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\\n\\n### Within Each User Story\\n\\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\\n- Models before services\\n- Services before endpoints\\n- Core implementation before integration\\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\\n\\n### Parallel Opportunities\\n\\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\\n- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\\n\\n```bash\\n# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):\\nTask: \\\"Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py\\\"\\n\\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\\n\\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\\n\\n### Incremental Delivery\\n\\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Verify tests fail before implementing\\n- Commit after each task or logical group\\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.3}}"}}

Beginner-Centered Communication\n+- MUST write code, docstrings, and supporting text so a beginner can follow the logic without\n+  prior context, using descriptive names over cleverness.\n+- MUST use docstrings following the Google style guide and add focused comments only where the\n+  intent is not obvious from the code.\n+- MUST explain every implementation session in plain language inside `change_log.md` on the day\n+  it happens so the tech lead can track learning progress.\n+Rationale: The project lead is new to programming; accessible language keeps momentum high and\n+prevents misunderstandings.\n+\n+### II. Behavior-Driven Development First\n+- MUST author failing Given/When/Then tests describing the desired behavior before writing or\n+  changing production code.\n+- MUST treat BDD scenarios as the canonical specification; any change to expected behavior\n+  demands a test update reviewed by the product owner.\n+- MUST keep features small enough that each scenario runs quickly and is easy to understand.\n+Rationale: Behavior-driven tests protect intent, create executable documentation, and keep the\n+team aligned on outcomes.\n+\n+### III. Python Quality Gates\n+- MUST follow PEP 8 formatting with four-space indentation, snake_case identifiers, and\n+  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment keys.\n+- MUST provide complete type hints, actionable error messages, and module/function docstrings to\n+  support discoverability and static analysis.\n+- MUST ensure linting, typing, and test suites run in continuous integration before merging.\n+Rationale: Consistent quality gates reduce regressions and give beginners confidence in the code\n+base.\n+\n+### IV. MVP Simplicity\n+- MUST default to the smallest working solution that delivers the user-facing goal before\n+  exploring enhancements or abstractions.\n+- MUST justify any increase in complexity inside the relevant spec or plan prior to\n+  implementation.\n+- SHOULD provide the AI assistant with sufficient context (even if high-token) when it materially\n+  improves solution accuracy or clarity.\n+Rationale: Lean increments support rapid learning, keep maintenance costs low, and accommodate\n+the MVP timeline.\n+\n+### V. Transparent Knowledge Sharing\n+- MUST log test results, design decisions, and follow-up actions alongside each change_log entry\n+  so future work starts with the latest insight.\n+- MUST surface blockers, open questions, and assumptions in plain language during hand-offs or\n+  asynchronous updates.\n+- SHOULD record links to supporting specs, plans, or notebooks whenever they inform a decision.\n+Rationale: Consistent knowledge capture empowers new contributors and preserves project intent.\n+\n+## Documentation Standards\n+- Every module, class, and function MUST include Google-style docstrings with clear descriptions\n+  and documented parameters, returns, raises, and examples when relevant.\n+- `change_log.md` MUST track the date, author, plain-language summary, impacted files, and next\n+  steps for each collaboration session.\n+- README and quickstart guides MUST stay aligned with the current MVP state and reference any\n+  BDD test suites needed to verify functionality.\n+- Inline comments MUST stay concise and purposeful; remove them when the code becomes\n+  self-explanatory.\n+\n+## Development Workflow\n+1. Capture the goal in a plain-language spec highlighting user stories and Given/When/Then\n+   scenarios.\n+2. Draft an implementation plan that references the spec, identifies BDD tests to create first,\n+   and confirms alignment with the Core Principles.\n+3. Implement by writing BDD scenarios, confirming they fail, and then writing the minimal code\n+   to make them pass while keeping quality gates green.\n+4. Record outcomes in `change_log.md`, update supporting docs, and share the beginner-friendly\n+   summary with the team.\n+5. Review and merge only after tests, linters, and type checkers pass and the plain-language\n+   explanation is complete.\n+\n+## Governance\n+- This constitution supersedes conflicting process documents; teams MUST align work with the Core\n+  Principles before delivery.\n+- Amendments REQUIRE a documented proposal, review of impacted templates, and confirmation from\n+  the product owner and tech lead. Record approved changes in `change_log.md`.\n+- Versioning follows semantic rules: increment MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new\n+  sections or mandates, PATCH for clarifications.\n+- Compliance reviews occur at the end of each sprint; any violation MUST be logged with a plan\n+  to resolve it in the next iteration.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-06 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-06\n*** End Patch"}}

Beginner-Centered Communication\\n- MUST write code, docstrings, and supporting text so a beginner can follow the logic without\\n  prior context, using descriptive names over cleverness.\\n- MUST use docstrings following the Google style guide and add focused comments only where the\\n  intent is not obvious from the code.\\n- MUST explain every implementation session in plain language inside `change_log.md` on the day\\n  it happens so the tech lead can track learning progress.\\nRationale: The project lead is new to programming; accessible language keeps momentum high and\\nprevents misunderstandings.\\n\\n### II. Behavior-Driven Development First\\n- MUST author failing Given/When/Then tests describing the desired behavior before writing or\\n  changing production code.\\n- MUST treat BDD scenarios as the canonical specification; any change to expected behavior\\n  demands a test update reviewed by the product owner.\\n- MUST keep features small enough that each scenario runs quickly and is easy to understand.\\nRationale: Behavior-driven tests protect intent, create executable documentation, and keep the\\nteam aligned on outcomes.\\n\\n### III. Python Quality Gates\\n- MUST follow PEP 8 formatting with four-space indentation, snake_case identifiers, and\\n  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment keys.\\n- MUST provide complete type hints, actionable error messages, and module/function docstrings to\\n  support discoverability and static analysis.\\n- MUST ensure linting, typing, and test suites run in continuous integration before merging.\\nRationale: Consistent quality gates reduce regressions and give beginners confidence in the code\\nbase.\\n\\n### IV. MVP Simplicity\\n- MUST default to the smallest working solution that delivers the user-facing goal before\\n  exploring enhancements or abstractions.\\n- MUST justify any increase in complexity inside the relevant spec or plan prior to\\n  implementation.\\n- SHOULD provide the AI assistant with sufficient context (even if high-token) when it materially\\n  improves solution accuracy or clarity.\\nRationale: Lean increments support rapid learning, keep maintenance costs low, and accommodate\\nthe MVP timeline.\\n\\n### V. Transparent Knowledge Sharing\\n- MUST log test results, design decisions, and follow-up actions alongside each change_log entry\\n  so future work starts with the latest insight.\\n- MUST surface blockers, open questions, and assumptions in plain language during hand-offs or\\n  asynchronous updates.\\n- SHOULD record links to supporting specs, plans, or notebooks whenever they inform a decision.\\nRationale: Consistent knowledge capture empowers new contributors and preserves project intent.\\n\\n## Documentation Standards\\n- Every module, class, and function MUST include Google-style docstrings with clear descriptions\\n  and documented parameters, returns, raises, and examples when relevant.\\n- `change_log.md` MUST track the date, author, plain-language summary, impacted files, and next\\n  steps for each collaboration session.\\n- README and quickstart guides MUST stay aligned with the current MVP state and reference any\\n  BDD test suites needed to verify functionality.\\n- Inline comments MUST stay concise and purposeful; remove them when the code becomes\\n  self-explanatory.\\n\\n## Development Workflow\\n1. Capture the goal in a plain-language spec highlighting user stories and Given/When/Then\\n   scenarios.\\n2. Draft an implementation plan that references the spec, identifies BDD tests to create first,\\n   and confirms alignment with the Core Principles.\\n3. Implement by writing BDD scenarios, confirming they fail, and then writing the minimal code\\n   to make them pass while keeping quality gates green.\\n4. Record outcomes in `change_log.md`, update supporting docs, and share the beginner-friendly\\n   summary with the team.\\n5. Review and merge only after tests, linters, and type checkers pass and the plain-language\\n   explanation is complete.\\n\\n## Governance\\n- This constitution supersedes conflicting process documents; teams MUST align work with the Core\\n  Principles before delivery.\\n- Amendments REQUIRE a documented proposal, review of impacted templates, and confirmation from\\n  the product owner and tech lead. Record approved changes in `change_log.md`.\\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: increment MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new\\n  sections or mandates, PATCH for clarifications.\\n- Compliance reviews occur at the end of each sprint; any violation MUST be logged with a plan\\n  to resolve it in the next iteration.\\n\\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-06 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-06\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

Beginner-Centered Communication\\n    15\\t- MUST write code, docstrings, and supporting text so a beginner can follow the logic without\\n    16\\t  prior context, using descriptive names over cleverness.\\n    17\\t- MUST use docstrings following the Google style guide and add focused comments only where the\\n    18\\t  intent is not obvious from the code.\\n    19\\t- MUST explain every implementation session in plain language inside `change_log.md` on the day\\n    20\\t  it happens so the tech lead can track learning progress.\\n    21\\t\\n    22\\tRationale: The project lead is new to programming; accessible language keeps momentum high and\\n    23\\tprevents misunderstandings.\\n    24\\t\\n    25\\t### II. Behavior-Driven Development First\\n    26\\t- MUST author failing Given/When/Then tests describing the desired behavior before writing or\\n    27\\t  changing production code.\\n    28\\t- MUST treat BDD scenarios as the canonical specification; any change to expected behavior\\n    29\\t  demands a test update reviewed by the product owner.\\n    30\\t- MUST keep features small enough that each scenario runs quickly and is easy to understand.\\n    31\\t\\n    32\\tRationale: Behavior-driven tests protect intent, create executable documentation, and keep the\\n    33\\tteam aligned on outcomes.\\n    34\\t\\n    35\\t### III. Python Quality Gates\\n    36\\t- MUST follow PEP 8 formatting with four-space indentation, snake_case identifiers, and\\n    37\\t  SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment keys.\\n    38\\t- MUST provide complete type hints, actionable error messages, and module/function docstrings to\\n    39\\t  support discoverability and static analysis.\\n    40\\t- MUST ensure linting, typing, and test suites run in continuous integration before merging.\\n    41\\t\\n    42\\tRationale: Consistent quality gates reduce regressions and give beginners confidence in the code\\n    43\\tbase.\\n    44\\t\\n    45\\t### IV. MVP Simplicity\\n    46\\t- MUST default to the smallest working solution that delivers the user-facing goal before\\n    47\\t  exploring enhancements or abstractions.\\n    48\\t- MUST justify any increase in complexity inside the relevant spec or plan prior to\\n    49\\t  implementation.\\n    50\\t- SHOULD provide the AI assistant with sufficient context (even if high-token) when it materially\\n    51\\t  improves solution accuracy or clarity.\\n    52\\t\\n    53\\tRationale: Lean increments support rapid learning, keep maintenance costs low, and accommodate\\n    54\\tthe MVP timeline.\\n    55\\t\\n    56\\t### V. Transparent Knowledge Sharing\\n    57\\t- MUST log test results, design decisions, and follow-up actions alongside each change_log entry\\n    58\\t  so future work starts with the latest insight.\\n    59\\t- MUST surface blockers, open questions, and assumptions in plain language during hand-offs or\\n    60\\t  asynchronous updates.\\n    61\\t- SHOULD record links to supporting specs, plans, or notebooks whenever they inform a decision.\\n    62\\t\\n    63\\tRationale: Consistent knowledge capture empowers new contributors and preserves project intent.\\n    64\\t\\n    65\\t## Documentation Standards\\n    66\\t- Every module, class, and function MUST include Google-style docstrings with clear descriptions\\n    67\\t  and documented parameters, returns, raises, and examples when relevant.\\n    68\\t- `change_log.md` MUST track the date, author, plain-language summary, impacted files, and next\\n    69\\t  steps for each collaboration session.\\n    70\\t- README and quickstart guides MUST stay aligned with the current MVP state and reference any\\n    71\\t  BDD test suites needed to verify functionality.\\n    72\\t- Inline comments MUST stay concise and purposeful; remove them when the code becomes\\n    73\\t  self-explanatory.\\n    74\\t\\n    75\\t## Development Workflow\\n    76\\t1. Capture the goal in a plain-language spec highlighting user stories and Given/When/Then\\n    77\\t   scenarios.\\n    78\\t2. Draft an implementation plan that references the spec, identifies BDD tests to create first,\\n    79\\t   and confirms alignment with the Core Principles.\\n    80\\t3. Implement by writing BDD scenarios, confirming they fail, and then writing the minimal code\\n    81\\t   to make them pass while keeping quality gates green.\\n    82\\t4. Record outcomes in `change_log.md`, update supporting docs, and share the beginner-friendly\\n    83\\t   summary with the team.\\n    84\\t5. Review and merge only after tests, linters, and type checkers pass and the plain-language\\n    85\\t   explanation is complete.\\n    86\\t\\n    87\\t## Governance\\n    88\\t- This constitution supersedes conflicting process documents; teams MUST align work with the Core\\n    89\\t  Principles before delivery.\\n    90\\t- Amendments REQUIRE a documented proposal, review of impacted templates, and confirmation from\\n    91\\t  the product owner and tech lead. Record approved changes in `change_log.md`.\\n    92\\t- Versioning follows semantic rules: increment MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new\\n    93\\t  sections or mandates, PATCH for clarifications.\\n    94\\t- Compliance reviews occur at the end of each sprint; any violation MUST be logged with a plan\\n    95\\t  to resolve it in the next iteration.\\n    96\\t\\n    97\\t**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-06 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-06\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.3}}"}}

No follow-up TODOs identified. Note: `.specify/templates/commands` does not exist in this repo, so no command references required updates.\n\nSuggested next step: 1) Apply the new BDD gates on the next feature plan to keep the process in sync.\n\nSuggested commit message: `docs: adopt constitution v1.0.0 and align delivery templates`"}}

{"timestamp":"2025-11-06T19:18:35.493Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"Documented a BDD-first constitution and synced the supporting templates for a beginner-friendly workflow.\n\n- Constitution now defines the five governing principles, documentation standards, workflow, governance, and embeds the Sync Impact Report at adoption (`.specify/memory/constitution.md:1`).\n- Plan template gates explicitly call for Given/When/Then scenarios, change_log planning, and quality checks aligned with the new principles (`.specify/templates/plan-template.md:34`).\n- Spec template reminds authors to write plain-language BDD scenarios and captures knowledge-sharing requirements for change_log and documentation updates (`.specify/templates/spec-template.md:8`, `120`).\n- Tasks template emphasizes drafting BDD tests before implementation and adds a standing task to record novice-friendly summaries in `change_log.md` (`.specify/templates/tasks-template.md:11`, `84`, `165`).\n- Logged today’s work in accessible language for the tech lead (`change_log.md:1`).\n\nVersion is now 1.0.0; treated as a MAJOR adoption because we populated the constitution for the first time. No follow-up TODOs identified. Note: `.specify/templates/commands` does not exist in this repo, so no command references required updates.\n\nSuggested next step: 1) Apply the new BDD gates on the next feature plan to keep the process in sync.\n\nSuggested commit message: `docs: adopt constitution v1.0.0 and align delivery templates`"}]}}
