meaning if you implement just ONE of them,\\n  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.\\n  \\n  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.\\n  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:\\n  - Developed independently\\n  - Tested independently\\n  - Deployed independently\\n  - Demonstrated to users independently\\n-->\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Capture Expense via Telegram (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAs a business owner chatting with the bot on Telegram, I want to describe an expense in everyday language so it can be recorded in ERPNext without opening the accounting system.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Delivers the core promise of hands-free expense capture, saving time for busy users.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Send a message such as \\\"Paid $10 cash for taxi\\\" and confirm the bot posts a matching ERPNext expense after approval.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the user is an authorized Telegram contact linked to their ERPNext profile, **When** they send \\\"I just had an expense of $10 from my cash account to the taxi account\\\", **Then** the bot replies with a summary showing amount, debit, credit, narration, and **Then** upon explicit confirmation the record appears in ERPNext with matching details and the bot shares the ERPNext document reference.\\n2. **Given** the user sends an expense message that references multiple possible ERPNext accounts, **When** the bot parses the text, **Then** it asks the user to choose the correct account before presenting the confirmation summary.\\n3. **Given** the user rejects the confirmation, **When** they reply \\\"cancel\\\" (or similar), **Then** the bot confirms the cancellation and no ERPNext entry is created.\\n4. **Given** someone whose Telegram account is not linked to ERPNext tries to submit an expense, **When** they send a message describing the expense, **Then** the bot declines the request and explains how to request access from a finance administrator.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Guide Missing Details (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAs a user, I want helpful prompts when my message is incomplete so I can fix it quickly instead of guessing what went wrong.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Clear guidance prevents frustration and builds trust in the bot’s assistance.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Send a partial message like \\\"Paid the taxi\\\" and confirm the conversation results in a complete, accurate expense or a graceful stop.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** the user submits \\\"Paid the taxi\\\", **When** the bot detects the missing amount, **Then** it asks for the amount before continuing the flow.\\n2. **Given** the user references an unknown account name, **When** the bot fails to find a matching ERPNext ledger, **Then** it tells the user the account is not recognized and offers next steps such as choosing an alternative or asking an administrator to add it.\\n3. **Given** ERPNext rejects an otherwise valid expense (for example, due to a closed accounting period), **When** the bot receives the error, **Then** it presents the failure reason in chat and offers to retry later or escalate to finance support.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Retain Conversation Trail (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAs a finance reviewer, I want to see the Telegram conversation that justified an expense so I can audit the entry\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n-->\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 90% of straightforward expense messages (amount and accounts clearly stated) result in the correct ERPNext accounts without manual intervention during pilot testing.\\n- **SC-002**: Median time from user message to confirmed ERPNext record remains under 60 seconds for successful submissions.\\n- **SC-003**: 100% of expenses recorded through the bot include a reference to the originating Telegram message and approving user.\\n- **SC-004**: Weekly error rate for failed ERPNext submissions stays below 2% after launch, with each failure surfaced to the user at the time it occurs.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Finance administrators will pre-register eligible Telegram users and provide each with a one-time code to link their chat identity to ERPNext.\\n- The finance team maintains a curated list of account aliases so the bot can translate common phrases to official ERPNext ledger names.\\n- Approved expenses will be recorded as ERPNext Journal Entries with debit/credit lines matching the user’s message unless finance policy changes later.\\n- ERPNext exposes an audit-friendly field where the original Telegram message text and identifiers can be stored or referenced.\\n- Current finance policy has no high-value approval threshold; all confirmed expenses should post automatically.\\n\\n## Knowledge Sharing Requirements\\n\\n- Summarize the feature in beginner-friendly language for `change_log.md`, highlighting how Telegram conversations create ERPNext expenses after confirmation.\\n- Update onboarding materials to explain how to link a Telegram account, submit an expense, review confirmations, and locate the resulting ERPNext records.\\n- Document required test suites (BDD chat scenarios, unit parsing checks, integration tests against a sandbox ERPNext tenant) and ensure they are referenced in CI instructions.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

It also provides middlewares for auth and throttling needed for finance data.  \\nAlternatives considered: `aiogram` (excellent but steeper learning curve for beginners, fewer synchronous examples in LangChain modules), manual REST polling (lighter dependency but would require rebuilding update parsing, keyboards, and rate limiting).\\n\\n## LangGraph Conversation Architecture\\n\\nDecision: Model the assistant with a `StateGraph` capturing `messages`, `conversation_summary`, `expense_draft`, `clarifications_needed`, and `erpnext_submission` fields, using `LangGraph` conditional edges to branch between information gathering, account resolution, confirmation, and ERP submission nodes.  \\nRationale: Mirrors module patterns (intent classifier → tool execution → human-in-the-loop) while keeping state explicit for auditing. Conditional edges let us loop for follow-up questions until the expense draft is complete before confirmation.  \\nAlternatives considered: A simple sequential chain (would complicate retries and branching for missing details), pure AgentExecutor (less transparent state management, harder to persist checkpoints), bespoke asyncio FSM (re-implements features LangGraph already provides).\\n\\n## Memory Strategy\\n\\nDecision: Persist conversation state with `langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver`, store the last 6 user/assistant messages in `messages`, and trigger a reducer node that summarizes older turns into `conversation_summary` when the window exceeds 6.  \\nRationale: Aligns with course guidance on checkpoint savers, gives Copilot-style “recent history + summary”, and the SQLite backend survives restarts. Summaries keep token usage bounded while retaining context for long-running finance chats.  \\nAlternatives considered: Unlimited history (token blow-up, expensive OpenAI calls), custom Redis store (more ops overhead), LLM-based retrieval memory per query (unnecessary complexity for MVP).\\n\\n## Account Resolution Tooling\\n\\nDecision: Retrieve the full ERPNext chart of accounts on each expense turn and provide it directly to the LLM so it can choose debit/credit ledgers without local caching or embeddings.  \\nRationale: Avoids reliance on OpenAI embedding APIs (currently unavailable) and keeps v1 simple while still giving the model all necessary data to pick accurate matches.  \\nAlternatives considered: Local caching + embeddings (deferred until embedding access issues resolved), fuzzy-matching heuristics (risk of incorrect ledger selection without semantic signals).\\n\\n## ERPNext Journal Entry Integration\\n\\nDecision: Use REST `POST /api/resource/Journal Entry` with bearer token auth (`token <api_key>:<api_secret>`), composing payloads with `accounts` debit/credit rows, `posting_date`, and custom fields storing the Telegram message ID + conversation URL; queue failures in SQLite for retry with exponential backoff up to 15 minutes.  \\nRationale: ERPNext’s documented REST pattern is stable, works with the existing API credentials, and journal entries accept structured account rows. Persisting retries locally satisfies the clarification about outage handling.  \\nAlternatives considered: ERPNext GraphQL (not universally enabled), Frappe client library (adds dependency with minimal benefit), webhook-based custom DocType (more ERPNext customization than necessary).\\n\\n## Testing Approach\\n\\nDecision: Adopt `pytest` for unit/integration coverage and `pytest-bdd` for the Given/When/Then chat scenarios referenced in the spec.  \\nRationale: Keeps the stack consistent (single test runner), integrates with fixtures for Telegram/ERP mocks, and lets us express BDD scenarios as inline Gherkin (materialized at runtime) that aligns with Constitution requirements.  \\nAlternatives considered: `behave` (separate runner complicates CI), plain pytest without BDD (violates Constitution), Robot Framework (overkill for Python-first repo).\\n\\n## Deployment & Scaling Assumptions\\n\\nDecision: Run the LangGraph + Telegram worker locally while connecting over HTTPS to the hosted ERPNext instance using existing API keys; continue targeting up to 50 concurrent users and 500 expenses/day.  \\nRationale: Matches the current infra setup (cloud ERPNext, local bot runtime), keeps network boundaries simple, and still supports the expected pilot scale.  \\nAlternatives considered: Deploying the bot beside ERPNext in the cloud (adds ops work for v1), assuming offline ERPNext access (inaccurate given hosted instance).\\n\\n## Documentation & Knowledge Sharing\\n\\nDecision: Update `change_log.md` with a beginner-friendly summary after implementation sessions and extend onboarding docs with a Quickstart covering env setup, Telegram linking, and ERPNext tracing steps.  \\nRationale: Satisfies Constitution Principles I & V and ensures stakeholders can track progress without inspecting code.  \\nAlternatives considered: Relying on inline code comments only (insufficient for onboarding), deferring documentation to post-implementation (risks omissions).\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.2}}"}}

Trace an entire application\\nNext steps\\nVideo guide\\nTracing quickstart\\nCopy pageCopy pageObservability is a critical requirement for applications built with large language models (LLMs). LLMs are non-deterministic, which means that the same prompt can produce different responses. This behavior makes debugging and monitoring more challenging than with traditional software.\\nLangSmith addresses this by providing end-to-end visibility into how your application handles a request. Each request generates a trace, which captures the full record of what happened. Within a trace are individual runs, the specific operations your application performed, such as an LLM call or a retrieval step. Tracing runs allows you to inspect, debug, and validate your application’s behavior.\\nIn this quickstart, you will set up a minimal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application and add tracing with LangSmith. You will:\\nConfigure your environment.\\nCreate an application that retrieves context and calls an LLM.\\nEnable tracing to capture both the retrieval step and the LLM call.\\nView the resulting traces in the LangSmith UI.\\nIf you prefer to watch a video on getting started with tracing, refer to the quickstart Video guide.\\n​Prerequisites\\nBefore you begin, make sure you have:\\nA LangSmith account: Sign up or log in at smith.langchain.com.\\nA LangSmith API key: Follow the Create an API key guide.\\nAn OpenAI API key: Generate this from the OpenAI dashboard.\\nThe example app in this quickstart will use OpenAI as the LLM provider. You can adapt the example for your app’s LLM provider.\\nIf you’re building an application with LangChain or LangGraph, you can enable LangSmith tracing with a single environment variable. Get started by reading the guides for tracing with LangChain or tracing with LangGraph.\\n​1.

Set up environment variables\\nSet the following environment variables:\\nLANGSMITH_TRACING\\nLANGSMITH_API_KEY\\nOPENAI_API_KEY (or your LLM provider’s API key)\\n(optional)\\nLANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID: If your LangSmith API key is linked to multiple workspaces, set this variable to specify which workspace to use.\\nCopyAsk AI\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\\\"<your-langsmith-api-key>\\\"\\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\\\"<your-openai-api-key>\\\"\\nexport LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=\\\"<your-workspace-id>\\\"\\nIf you’re using Anthropic, use the Anthropic wrapper to trace your calls. For other providers, use the traceable wrapper.\\n​3. Define your application\\nYou can use the example app code outlined in this step to instrument a RAG application. Or, you can use your own application code that includes an LLM call.\\nThis is a minimal RAG app that uses the OpenAI SDK directly without any LangSmith tracing added yet. It has three main parts:\\nRetriever function: Simulates document retrieval that always returns the same string.\\nOpenAI client: Instantiates a plain OpenAI client to send a chat completion request.\\nRAG function: Combines the retrieved documents with the user’s question to form a system prompt, calls the\\nchat.completions.create() endpoint with\\ngpt-4o-mini, and returns the assistant’s response.\\nAdd the following code into your app file (e.g.,\\napp.py or\\napp.ts):\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyAsk AI\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\ndef retriever(query: str):\\n# Minimal example retriever\\nreturn [\\\"Harrison worked at Kensho\\\"]\\n# OpenAI client call (no wrapping yet)\\nclient = OpenAI()\\ndef rag(question: str) -> str:\\ndocs = retriever(question)\\nsystem_message = (\\n\\\"Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\\\\n\\\"\\n+ \\\"\\\\n\\\".join(docs)\\n)\\n# This call is not traced yet\\nresp = client.chat.completions.create(\\nmodel=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\nmessages=[\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": system_message},\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": question},\\n],\\n)\\nreturn resp.choices[0].message.content\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\nprint(rag(\\\"Where did Harrison work?\\\"))\\n​4. Trace LLM calls\\nTo start, you’ll trace all your OpenAI calls. LangSmith provides wrappers:\\nPython:\\nwrap_openai\\nTypeScript:\\nwrapOpenAI\\nThis snippet wraps the OpenAI client so that every subsequent model call is logged automatically as a traced child run in LangSmith.\\nInclude the highlighted lines in your app file:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyAsk AI\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai  # traces openai calls\\ndef retriever(query: str):\\nreturn [\\\"Harrison worked at Kensho\\\"]\\nclient = wrap_openai(OpenAI())  # log traces by wrapping the model calls\\ndef rag(question: str) -> str:\\ndocs = retriever(question)\\nsystem_message = (\\n\\\"Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\\\\n\\\"\\n+ \\\"\\\\n\\\".join(docs)\\n)\\nresp = client.chat.completions.create(\\nmodel=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\nmessages=[\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": system_message},\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": question},\\n],\\n)\\nreturn resp.choices[0].message.content\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\nprint(rag(\\\"Where did Harrison work?\\\"))\\nCall your application:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyAsk AI\\npython app.py\\nYou’ll receive the following output:\\nCopyAsk AI\\nHarrison worked at Kensho.\\nIn the LangSmith UI, navigate to the default Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in Step 2). You’ll see the OpenAI call you just instrumented.\\n​5. Trace an entire application\\nYou can also use the\\ntraceable decorator for Python or TypeScript to trace your entire application instead of just the LLM calls.\\nInclude the highlighted code in your app file:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyAsk AI\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nfrom langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai\\nfrom langsmith import traceable\\ndef retriever(query: str):\\nreturn [\\\"Harrison worked at Kensho\\\"]\\nclient = wrap_openai(OpenAI())  # keep this to capture the prompt and response from the LLM\\n@traceable\\ndef rag(question: str) -> str:\\ndocs = retriever(question)\\nsystem_message = (\\n\\\"Answer the user's question using only the provided information below:\\\\n\\\"\\n+ \\\"\\\\n\\\".join(docs)\\n)\\nresp = client.chat.completions.create(\\nmodel=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\nmessages=[\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": system_message},\\n{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": question},\\n],\\n)\\nreturn resp.choices[0].message.content\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\nprint(rag(\\\"Where did Harrison work?\\\"))\\nCall the application again to create a run:\\nPythonTypeScriptCopyAsk AI\\npython app.py\\nReturn to the LangSmith UI, navigate to the default Tracing Project for your workspace (or the workspace you specified in Step 2). You’ll find a trace of the entire app pipeline with the rag step and the ChatOpenAI LLM call.\\n​Next steps\\nHere are some topics you might want to explore next:\\nTracing integrations provide support for various LLM providers and agent frameworks.\\nFiltering traces can help you effectively navigate and analyze data in tracing projects that contain a significant amount of data.\\nTrace a RAG application is a full tutorial, which adds observability to an application from development through to production.\\nSending traces to a specific project changes the destination project of your traces.\\n​Video guide\\nEdit the source of this page on GitHub.\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.1}}"}}

I'll check the package source and docs to confirm best practices for setting these."}],"content":null,"encrypted_content":"gAAAAABpFUgaYTsDbUFJ-xaBmeNVV9DKXJVoYRspvipQmIIO66vhdqWc_wJuEsp-94GS4MhV5D8tixPvRyUE0mfwn6h4NcQgjnB_2EGgCTW6sdGiVMVMJH8pRTN6pOVC3l3E8DT3wtbyl4jYc7pUBi-XORmos9doR7Q_0OFT8Wahdheg0vFKza0C8qcGMVHcoFCJ6OpvNJXOlMIz8Ap5V5_q_BJpI4YEJlJupS9kRw9Lt8TFLbj5aqsSc0b7xIsyKuoEBaZhJG77e6tNWeoX672SiZOcFlUDVVIY-uFJ4vKixeE1aPlDwW4K2FnKRpIVE8GtwtfGhMAdUjb5Fs4mxSAwQpQz6uhASHllnGQAjht0EQzcL-YcekN5_OMiUxCKb1vWoZucis2ZVPAVQrCVyce1-6Yflr0mu7ZQiIJ7cRPbTg82izHhu1BwRf3ER1vfisnL1dHXYpnRuaDj2TST-lH0_HHmXnV382-WbpkzZVy20rHCwFmyE9y2Rt2uosTc9TUcctMSIE1p9IDSYW5vVnUttP5hAT4yrzx9VyLY6H3weDcxj5xBi26MHcbGujJxqppo4g6FWyB333EMfgZfn_VTfHSkDTO6HC0OwwOTDwXHkS9iqkPuvPGr8_7gKr0xenDvZKv10O_vck2IDa_YdgxgPQrxooEAy-CePEHqmpTeoJ-UhQNBiiWjTojLikAWdU0y7DN5guNTrumFZVnPRRIKMtu3GitfyhurP4J8_-ln8gvxSVNsKFqul1ZZLp8qv_T64SYwK40lYX2YPfu58Wb3XRX8l-sR8zQdlFTPOLhyE7TKk9hwjKynIgdoWehPGrwcyl8AuKG60IxUrMdVlry1L_OUy7NMo0atrRrRhS7nMEaK4hx748zGxAzu7meszvVBDOFGI7l2iLfwoAmTV_HEh4iDbNlGW-9fsxb7hN7qqlYM7OzxXC33nui_m3slnbVZFszPIml5-PVVJ7YaEu0obpB7Q_7b5ENMnwXsquKQSSi1c_EELaQoVXE0kRx5bFAUgy3PEBN4EW4qLJDdK7Q5i7gU0GE5rGIgSidsk2sBw94ho1uYN2KIXfMjVwpIdOomb9PR_i_JJ98P2u1vbqEmU5qLoWpb4gDpfI48nMlgFSqXrzn3hfmnCEVfR-HwINsSJbxyVSBQpfFTE8qgBbucsaPdDhrKb9qkf5T79FZ7-RFvGtKOCWnSTWNDN_L-OQL0jCemRkpur8BisPjwhpPpNoTSU7gIVvI7k1V_mF13ANc_AS57_H9548236BKWRPuqJNwQFXad664WFivsCs5YOIqvCPGQuLgqRS6xFrozimrejQ8qY2cNCWNcpPcR1NqB1GbYLtJ8H1Hdg4qKrDgJSD3ZZmHGMIl9RO4z9cAENJIW2wHnw6oYw59wZTMyi1pX7anBSS63IXnzu7XBJOtdxK6PXsjTu_dsgtZz9wgbbm2Z5Junrp2I0sCnHxFzRBFKAqkEBVZgsecgfa8gZr9Gge7SIJqoyoE2_M1y9eTc-dHDibyO3Ce-4ZwBeBpuoaE0Lq0T-RIzQFH0oYxZIAHixsWXdkpeABeVBP0-Wn6zEHPr4FHTvj5CxcOmbR6fZHNoZQFKzBct6tCPg62gz5oCGUBJXaOxnCZlzOSjbbbRyEZjYlk2GBjblLOQ8aakDAQ1lh-cPTR9HCZSqRixMf49aLdSWJXT0ijaGzlmHdcszpgrHxTsdVFevCpPo-mt3wsVOpOMdJ1TTGXUa9aXBGp0V99XB72a9-cscPDZmKmhIGQWMO3WZTCyuFo_srjTYCRouv1Nalh1MQYpH5UVbnRCZXJ3FU_jsvcJBlrrmk90xYDJH732g_DtrUOPkbHmmC93r2lKjLO1EVgBZnUoNYpm40G4wKI7Yvl0axvJqIvZpX8YAu1FxgA3Niz91W9cLDUDdtIffpLRJaQIirdnM7h_yfkufStFy2d9HsNfcdWycpK8a6K9fFIff3cdgGG6pODe-6jOuZUY6XnalY8SGOY_BDgOJNo760iZqQXkKrjDFYOhbP5ZbmKuU_QO6JJRYdBKRoGWa08BSpvsv327ZRg4r05IKT2sPc3Tn5TVIwhpob-exoJ8h70JTm72_ITAW_8UBGs8diYn828kG8AGp-0GQN3KkQhJ865-hgmuFDCcWFk888ZJxguaUac-vn0zWDgSswKaJWyW-81RzRabOjHg-En98MAcxUuGlRK-WOzCfFBsaHjOc4kX_Lcp1Tmpa-K-mDHQ6lVzfJtdq_bZXaf71FmR62mSyRhIx6pmhPplOgI-R9jY5ago2LMGsdgaRfGn5lUmFdpYHvKVNqbgkadnFEUFv6NDMJ_tNoKAYXVawW5CQNx9DXv3y-YYM-w5YBLBBjHKKoGlkdLUAKNPJ4Ncyl7PZQYBi1HI2iija3xqBpIr4nNMqtkP5V4UfkPO4wnJQSoQEz0KWrTJM4fKDU-hLKqsb8B7_VAKMrb8Sfp3Zgw0S-wDI8MiXtzAaxtl9COguOxfC1C06m6491I7rWEzHQX_9u6UsHUQ3zCc7wj42ZPKnSM2gvlpzcuiW5B28WHdv23nUBYxcBrTLHg62vDAJfKeeC7hWOC0aE4h69odhkDyAMC-FsYq08gE50kquqPunRECFsIS5mQvvysTOowqjAnlzAlNxcswKciIPAt0rpTkUg-ts3if_lKThdUNIaV4duK-UcPPS6e_LTHiCRaolWwnNZQb0GqICYCRTwOin8uWPBD8yUXN3718ILFT7VGM-5GJyxJTdn04JRNe4OxP4gvTNy9u2QFvKxORvwElupOU4EhN5WMhLtW4uls8dZlCg0fYY49VjJsGmQJ5JWSzTwa6DnC4blbY0MPFqeMQ9_mwQZkzEBo50fzDppvhzut9zRPDX3cRFoEHrDeo1Ev_YL1WIailzrOXudxTc5rgsgp72uto7ex5tc2yXs2sBRx8LMWSL95SHARvvolvbji0duzSeq1dW8yX4Uktx9eLQVPgWIb1meuP2Ec_nwNJFj_mJ-xsspLE3m3f37xJRdVZhaBgfqwozhvQg7n0qEp-KTd-igxszhTkxyIk_14NVYzXT3Q5TkJuNDE4hPF98AwrSOL6AIic47b7oo9otqly6DfNvSoukOZ85Flum5wP1a9UTSfzh2XfYtDsvjU2WmS399NVHu3CtV3fpYhzWWwAli57PH9srgqbdT1RrguPsKTb6ajKuupx4ZQqesVUBfLtnDJTjELEl3OhRCVo95Vi8X15Gs8JWOZzzTj5w2LgWrfgpBFAsAZ39OT6AM0gLIC4aBWpVfQmCjQbVqG0qIREKpwruFrqQzA0-mzASMXGBvM3krlCaQ2t4TdG_KlkvdgPCOwGddan9s6uqJHlMdXgZP6mBC-KjRUYEJr_VNnkTqeB4tqZs6LD9o_9xsu3Csn60_v1gVQcEFBwTEnefHeWKqAXgJsA20P_eUMD4UJ6aNmpy0s-BDbJBuaZt1uLjK1kvffce2tkdburN63g9H0rqB_6mLgc4asE-RoG1NHZKs8SN9nKgL88cAwVhdPpwZ0hmuMMExQhFt8D-BRJ5ZxyrrkP9VDBMFszPSpUpm60G_zS91xhfqLug5jbaaVmknfldQfIUi3qGynQuZtv14QAerbWmCbWfJfC7WB57u3p3n8sodEl-d8ioR59XbytonfjdOJWoHJdTAfHQaDFRsvyE7db8uFtmH_NRdhCy-ViTJF2r30QaZfHLHIiMPpJ-o4JHgjYE3RjL2oyTHFvUAAAa9HwM7oRmtkiQyWgCj3AlPxopV5i0XMBG1lxNG544ZMH4SsJh-S7t32YaLvWOJdAYh8lMSz-Bk1acIgFmroN3_qBIPckYt0zz1chWhNi1GKWSys_FbiqED4g9nzhHuQ9_nZYsFOKV7jxbphQlsGip7l6XBRE2ppaYzny1rdpmFNkE7KAWaUpHhVbe6Uwd7JCPX11VG6EGjiOyXEeWuTHw_smTBF5gfo4MXOYeFGeH3PBPdvq6iWGD28WpBKmxVjTdG79mMjohF5mZBGruhyRwD1lUyvkE75fGY2VFy-aPSewjko9rRl7OA=="}}

{"timestamp":"2025-11-13T03:01:20.533Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"output_text","text":"- **Summary:** Telegram handlers now call `_process_telegram_update` through a `@traceable` span that collects thread/user/message metadata via `_langsmith_extra_for_update`, so each incoming update emits a LangSmith trace enriched with snippet, event type, and tags before any graph execution (`src/expense_bot/integrations/telegram.py:256-525`).\n\n- **ERPNext tracing:** `ERPNextClient` now routes both `fetch_chart_of_accounts` and `post_journal_entry` through traced helpers that attach company/limit/line-count metadata, so every account read or journal post becomes a LangSmith span as well (`src/expense_bot/integrations/erpnext.py:97-210`).\n\n- **Tracing config:** The `.env.example` now documents the LangSmith/LangChain tracing flags (`LANGSMITH_TRACING`, `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`) plus the API/workspace/project identifiers that the LangSmith Observability Quickstart (https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability-quickstart steps 1‑5) calls for to enable online tracing and link the workspace to your API key (`.env.example:24-30`).\n\n- **Testing:** Not run (not requested).\n\n- **Next steps:** 1) Copy the new tracing vars from `.env.example` into your actual `.env` (use your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, optional `LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID`, and set `LANGSMITH_TRACING_V2=true` before starting the bot). 2) When you wire in OpenAI/LLM calls, wrap those clients with `from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai` and/or decorate the higher-level functions with `@langsmith.traceable` so the LangSmith UI shows the full RAG/LLM funnel as the Quickstart recommends. 3) After restarting, inspect the LangSmith project/dashboard referenced by your workspace to ensure Telegram updates and ERPNext interactions appear as spans with the metadata we now emit."}]}}
